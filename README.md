In order to distinguish the topic, this folder does not retain the original folder structure, the original structure is:

The evaluation code of the three models (ac_evl.py, dqn_evl.py, reinforce_evaluate.py) are modified according to the model instantiation rules.

The model is renamed after the code completes the output, so it is possible that the model name in the code and the submitted model name do not match. (If I feel dizzy from staying up late)

Thanks to ARTS1425 teachers and teaching assistants, the games are fun!
